Hi <%= @user.login %>,

we'd like remind you that VPS <%= @vps.id %> <%= @vps.hostname %> is running in rescue mode
for more than 24 hours. Restart the VPS to exit the rescue mode.

The rescue system is temporary and is deleted when the VPS is restarted. It is
also not backed up, so should you have any configuration or data on it that you
wish to preserve, please make your own copy before restarting the VPS.

For more information about the rescue mode, see KB:

  https://kb.vpsfree.org/manuals/vps/vpsadminos/recovery#rescue_mode

If you acknowledge this issue, you will not receive any more alerts until it's
resolved. However, it will not make the issue go away, merely silence it:

  <%= url('monitoring', "action=ack&id=#{@event.id}") %>

Best regards,

vpsFree.cz team
