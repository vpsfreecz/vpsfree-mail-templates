Hi <%= @user.login %>,

VPS <%= @vps.id %> <%= @vps.hostname %> has too many zombie processes: <%= @zombie_process_count %>.

Zombie processes accumulate inside the VPS either because the parent process
is not waiting on them, or the init system itself has malfunctioned. If the number
of zombie processes will exceed <%= @threshold %>, an automated restart of this
VPS will be planned for operational reasons.

If you acknowledge this issue, you will not receive any more alerts until it's
resolved. However, it will not make the issue go away, merely silence it:

  <%= url('monitoring', "action=ack&id=#{@event.id}") %>

Best regards,
