Hi <%= @user.login %>,

<% days = %i(Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday) -%>
VPS <%= @vps.id %> <%= @vps.hostname %> has a large amount of zombie processes
(> <%= @threshold %>) and we're going to restart it on <%= days[@finish_weekday] %> <%= sprintf('%02d:%02d', @finish_minutes / 60, @finish_minutes % 60) %> for operational reasons.

Zombie processes accumulate inside the VPS either because the parent process
is not waiting on them, or the init system itself has malfunctioned.

In case the date and time wouldn't be convenient for you, please reply to this
e-mail.

Best regards,

vpsFree.cz team
