Hi <%= @user.login %>,

this is an automated message from vpsAdmin, the administration system of vpsFree.cz.
It's the first e-mail you receive as a member, so please read it carefully.

You can manage VPS, NAS, playground, payments and many other things in vpsAdmin.
<% if @user.object_state == 'suspended' -%>

Please note that your account will be activated only after we receive a payment
of the membership fee. Until then, you will not be able to use the VPS, but you
can look around in the administration interface. If you'd like to test the VPS
before you pay, please contact our support (see below), acknowledge that you
intend to pay the membership fee if all is well and request a tryout period.
<% end -%>

However, before you login, please remember that your VPS is accessible from
the public Internet. Many bots will try to connect to your VPS, guess passwords
and exploit vulnerabilties of frequently used software. It is important not to
underestimate the security: use strong passwords, update your software and do not
transfer your password unencrypted.
