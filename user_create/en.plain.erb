interface. If you'd like to test the VPS before you pay, please contact our support
(see below), acknowledge that you intend to pay the membership fee if all will be well
and request a tryout period.

the public Internet. Many bots will try to connect to your VPS, guess passwords
and exploit vulnerabilties of frequently used software. It is important not to
underestimate the security: use strong passwords, update your software and do not
transfer your password unencrypted.
