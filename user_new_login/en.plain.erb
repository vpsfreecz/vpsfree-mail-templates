Hi <%= @user.login %>,

We noticed a login to your vpsAdmin account (https://vpsadmin.vpsfree.cz)
from a new device.

  Service:        <%= @authorization.oauth2_client.name %>
  Date and time:  <%= @user_session.created_at.localtime.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z') %>
  User agent:     <%= @user_device.user_agent.agent %>
  IP address:     <%= @user_device.client_ip_addr %>
  Reverse record: <%= @user_device.client_ip_ptr %>

If this was you, you can disregard this message. Otherwise we recommend changing
