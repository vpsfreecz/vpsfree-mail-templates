Hi <%= @user.login %>,

We have detected the use of a recovery code for TOTP authentication when logging
into your vpsAdmin account (https://vpsadmin.vpsfree.cz). Recovery code can be
used for emergency login to your account when no authentication device is
available.

  Date and time:         <%= @time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') %>
  Authentication device: <%= @totp_device.label %>
  IP address:            <%= @request.env['HTTP_CLIENT_IP'] || @request.ip %>
  User agent:            <%= @request.user_agent %>

The authentication device was disabled.

Should you have any questions, please contact podpora@vpsfree.cz.

Best regards,

vpsFree.cz team
