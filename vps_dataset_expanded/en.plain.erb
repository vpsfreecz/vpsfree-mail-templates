Hi <%= @vps.user.login %>,

VPS <%= @vps.id %> <%= @vps.hostname %> is running out of disk space. We have
expanded your dataset by <%= (@expansion.added_space / 1024).round %> GiB to keep the VPS functional.

Dataset:         <%= @dataset.full_name %>
Original size:   <%= (@expansion.original_refquota / 1024.0).round %> GiB
New size:        <%= (@dataset.refquota / 1024.0).round %> GiB
Used space:      <%= (@dataset.referenced / 1024.0).round(2) %> GiB
<% if @expansion.active? -%>
Expansion count: <%= @expansion.expansion_count %><% if @expansion.stop_vps -%>/3<% end %>
<% if @expansion.deadline -%>
Resolve until:   <%= @expansion.deadline.localtime.strftime("%Y-%m-%d") %>
<% end -%>

Please either try to free some space so that the dataset could be returned to its
original size, or contact us if you need to expand your disk space permanently,
see:

  https://kb.vpsfree.org/information/membership_fees#what_the_membership_fee_is_composed_of
<% if @expansion.stop_vps -%>

Datasets can be auto-expanded at most three times and can remain expanded for
up to 30 days. After that, the VPS is stopped for operational reasons until
the issue is resolved.
<% end -%>
<% if @expansion.enable_shrink -%>

vpsAdmin will automatically return the dataset to its original size when there
is at least 5 % of free space with respect to the original size. That is when
there will be at most <%= ((@expansion.original_refquota / 1024.0 / 100) * 95).round(2) %> GiB of used space. You can also shrink the dataset
yourself in vpsAdmin.
<% end -%>
<% else -%>

The new dataset size fits within your account's assigned disk space. Feel free
to check the VPS if the increased storage usage is unexpected, otherwise no
action is needed from you.
<% end -%>

Best regards,

vpsFree.cz team
