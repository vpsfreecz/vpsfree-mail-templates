Hi <%= @vps.user.login %>,

VPS <%= @vps.id %> <%= @vps.hostname %> is temporarily expanded and is using
more disk space than you have available. Please take a look at it if you can
free some space or if you need to expand your disk permanently.

Dataset:         <%= @dataset.full_name %>
Original size:   <%= (@expansion.original_refquota / 1024.0).round %> GiB
Current size:    <%= (@dataset.refquota / 1024.0).round %> GiB
Used space:      <%= (@dataset.referenced / 1024.0).round(2) %> GiB
Expansion count: <%= @expansion.dataset_expansion_histories.count %><% if @expansion.stop_vps -%>/3<% end %>
<% if @expansion.deadline -%>
Resolve until:   <%= @expansion.deadline.localtime.strftime("%Y-%m-%d") %>
<% end -%>

See KB for more information:

  https://kb.vpsfree.org/information/membership_fees#what_the_membership_fee_is_composed_of
<% if @expansion.stop_vps -%>

Datasets can be auto-expanded at most three times and can remain expanded for
up to 30 days. After that, the VPS is stopped for operational reasons until
the issue is resolved.
<% end -%>

vpsAdmin will automatically return the dataset to its original size when there
is at least 5 % of free space with respect to the original size. That is when
there will be at most <%= ((@expansion.original_refquota / 1024.0 / 100) * 95).round(2) %> GiB of used space. You can also shrink the dataset
yourself in vpsAdmin.

Best regards,

vpsFree.cz team
