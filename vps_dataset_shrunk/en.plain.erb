Hi <%= @vps.user.login %>,

dataset <%= @dataset.full_name %> in VPS <%= @vps.id %> <%= @vps.hostname %> has been shrunk back
to its original size of <%= (@expansion.original_refquota / 1024.0).round %> GiB and is no longer expanded.

Thank you for resolving this issue.

Best regards,

vpsFree.cz team
