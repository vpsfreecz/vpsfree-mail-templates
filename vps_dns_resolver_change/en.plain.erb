Hi <%= @vps.user.login %>,

<% if @old_dns_resolver.id == @new_dns_resolver.id -%>
DNS resolver "<%= @new_dns_resolver.label %>" used by VPS <%= @vps.id %> <%= @vps.hostname %>
has new IP addresses. We have already updated /etc/resolv.conf file inside
the VPS. No action is required from you unless you have its addresses
configured somewhere else as well.
<% else -%>
VPS <%= @vps.id %> <%= @vps.hostname %> had its DNS resolver changed from
"<%= @old_dns_resolver.label %>" to "<%= @new_dns_resolver.label %>" due to
a configuration change at vpsFree.cz. /etc/resolv.conf file inside the VPS
has already been updated. No action is required from you unless you have
its addresses configured somewhere else as well.
<% end -%>

The DNS server now has the following IP addresses:

<% @new_dns_resolver.addrs.split(',').each do |addr| -%>
  - <%= addr %>
<% end -%>

Best regards,

vpsFree.cz team
