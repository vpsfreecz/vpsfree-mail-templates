Hi <%= @vps.user.login %>,

migration of VPS #<%= @vps.id %> <%= @vps.hostname %> from <%= @src_node.domain_name %> to <%= @dst_node.domain_name %> has begun.
<% if @maintenance_window %><% days = %i(Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat) %>
The migration will be finished within the closest possible maintenance window:
<% @vps.vps_maintenance_windows.where(is_open: true).order('weekday').each do |w| %>  - <%= days[w.weekday] %> from <%= sprintf('%02d:%02d', w.opens_at / 60, w.opens_at % 60) %> to <%= sprintf('%02d:%02d', w.closes_at / 60, w.closes_at % 60) %>
<% end %><% end %>
<% if @reason %>Reason: <%= @reason %><% end %>

The VPS will have a short outage during the migration, as the VPS is stopped
on the source node and started on the destination node. The VPS will see this
as a system restart.

Until the migration is finished, you won't be able to control the VPS from
vpsAdmin. Please contact the support in case of an emergency.

Best regards,

vpsAdmin @ vpsFree.cz
