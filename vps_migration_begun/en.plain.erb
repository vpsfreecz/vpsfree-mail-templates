Hi <%= @vps.user.login %>,

migration of VPS #<%= @vps.id %> <%= @vps.hostname %> from <%= @src_node.domain_name %> to <%= @dst_node.domain_name %> has begun.

<% if @maintenance_window -%>
<% days = %i(Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat) -%>
The migration will be finished within the closest possible maintenance window:

<% @maintenance_windows.each do |w| -%>
  - <%= days[w.weekday] %> from <%= sprintf('%02d:%02d', w.opens_at / 60, w.opens_at % 60) %> to <%= sprintf('%02d:%02d', w.closes_at / 60, w.closes_at % 60) %>
<% end -%>

<% elsif @custom_window -%>
<% days = %i(Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday) -%>
The migration will be finished on <%= days[@finish_weekday] %> from <%= sprintf('%02d:%02d', @finish_minutes / 60, @finish_minutes % 60) %>.

<% end -%>
<% if @reason -%>
Reason: <%= @reason %>

<% end -%>
The VPS will have a short outage during the migration, as the VPS is stopped
on the source node and started on the destination node. The VPS will see this
as a system restart.

Until the migration is finished, you won't be able to control the VPS from
vpsAdmin. Please contact the support in case of an emergency.
