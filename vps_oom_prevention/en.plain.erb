Hi <%= @vps.user.login %>,

VPS <%= @vps.id %> <%= @vps.hostname %> is out of memory too often:

  <%= @ooms_in_period %> out-of-memory situations in the last <%= @period_seconds / 60 %> minutes, <%= (@ooms_in_period / @period_seconds.to_f).round(1) %> per second

The VPS was <%= @action == :restart ? 'restarted' : 'shut down' %> for operational reasons. Please look into it.

Best regards,

vpsFree.cz team
