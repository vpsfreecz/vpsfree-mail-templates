Hi <%= @original_vps.user.login %>,

VPS <%= @original_vps.id %> <%= @original_vps.hostname %> is unresponsive and we were forced to
clone it under a new ID <%= @new_vps.id %>. Configuration and data remain the same.
<% if @reason && !@reason.empty? -%>

Reason: <%= @reason %>
<% end -%>

VPS have to be replaced when one or more processes get stuck in Linux kernel
and cannot be killed. This is usually a bug within the kernel. Reply to this
e-mail if you'd like more information.
