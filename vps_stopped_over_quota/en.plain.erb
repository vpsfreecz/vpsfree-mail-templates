Hi <%= @vps.user.login %>,

VPS <%= @vps.id %> <%= @vps.hostname %> was stopped, because its dataset uses too much space.

Dataset:         <%= @dataset.full_name %>
Original size:   <%= (@expansion.original_refquota / 1024.0).round %> GiB
Current size:    <%= (@dataset.refquota / 1024.0).round %> GiB
Used space:      <%= (@dataset.referenced / 1024.0).round(2) %> GiB
Expansion count: <%= @expansion.expansion_count %>/3
<% if @expansion.deadline -%>
Deadline:        <%= @expansion.deadline.localtime.strftime("%Y-%m-%d") %>
<% end -%>

Please either try to free some space so that the dataset could be returned to its
original size, or contact us if you need to expand your disk space permanently,
see:

  https://kb.vpsfree.org/information/membership_fees#what_the_membership_fee_is_composed_of

You can start the VPS, but unless you will resolve the issue, it will be stopped
again.
<% if @expansion.enable_shrink -%>

vpsAdmin will automatically return the dataset to its original size when there
is at least 5 % of free space with respect to the original size. That is when
there will be at most <%= ((@expansion.original_refquota / 1024.0 / 100) * 95).round(2) %> GiB of used space. You can also shrink the dataset
yourself in vpsAdmin.
<% end -%>

Best regards,
